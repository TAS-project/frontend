# how to run code of frontend and backend in your vscode

run step 1 and 2 together to see the resut.

1- Step 1 : clone frontend

make a folder you want to put the frontend react js code which cloned from github in it.
open TAS-project in github and clone master branch of frontend repository with this script :
`git clone {the url of master branch of frontend repo}`
when you clone frontend :
if you use npm, you should first run the script `npm install` which installs the required dependencies. after that
then run `npm start` to run the React project and show the result in browser.
if you use yarn, you should first run the script `yarn build ` and `yarn start`.
</br>
</br>

2- Step 2 : Clone backend

make a folder you want to put the backend react js code which cloned from github in it.
open TAS-project in github and clone backend repository with this script :
`git clone {the url of backend repo}`
when you clone backend :
if you use npm, you should first run the script `npm install` which installs the required dependencies. after that
then run `node index.js` to run the server.
if you use yarn, you should first run the script `yarn build ` and `node index.js`.

this project used MYSQL as database:
1- install MYSQL
2- install HeidiSQL to make tables
3- install postman to notice the inputs that should be send to backend and token given from backend.

</br>
</br>
Pay attention to .env file, this file is loaded with your most important data.

PORT, SQL_PORT, JWT_SECRET, JWT_EXPIRES_IN, DATABASE_USERNAME, DATABASE_PASSWORD, DATABASE, HOST, DIALECT PHOTOS_PREFIX

You need to fill these values with corect inputs in order to create and use database and back end.

</br>
create a data base table and
after npm install `uncomment the line 21 of index.js` to create database tables.

then run this script for seeders:
</br></br>
`npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed Seeder_Users Seeder_Genres Seeder_Books Seeder_Book_Genres Seeder_Chapter Seeder_Comment Seeder_Follow_User Seeder_Bookmark`

</br>
</br>

### After running seeders use these credentials to enter the website or create a new user:
